Hacking on phonesim
*******************

phonesim is a soft modem that eliminates the need to have an actual AT
modem connected to the system for testing and developing Ofono.


Build tools requirements
========================

qmake is required, as is Qt 5.


Working with the source code repository
=======================================

  Checkout repository
    # git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/network/ofono/phonesim.git
    # cd phonesim

  Configure and build
    # qmake
    # make

  Final installation
    # sudo make install


Running from within the source code repository
==============================================

  Run phonesim in foreground using the following options
    # ./src/phonesim -p 12345 -gui src/default.xml

Check your modem.conf file and enable the phonesim configuration before
executing the above command. Argument -p should be followed by the proper
port number, in case you have changed the default "12345". Argument -gui
will launch the gui once the modem is enabled.

To enable the modem, make sure the ofono daemon is running and execute the
enable-modem script with /phonesim argument (default defined in modem.conf,
change if changes to that section has been made). The AT chat can then
be seen in the GUI window. Running the script disable-modem with /phonesim
argument will turn off the soft modem.

The default.xml can be tweaked further to include additional AT-Commands and
supposed responses from the soft modem.
